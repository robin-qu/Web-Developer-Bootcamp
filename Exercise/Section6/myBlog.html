            <h2>Neymar: Barcelona offer PSG £90m plus two players for Brazil forward</h2>

            <p class="first">Barcelona have made a £90m offer plus two players for Paris Saint-Germain
                forward Neymar, according to Sky in Germany. The La Liga club have given 
                PSG a list of six players that could be included in the deal, including 
                Philippe Coutinho, Ousmane Dembele, Ivan Rakitic, Nelson Semedo, and Malcom.
            </p>

            <p>It is understood the French club want over £200m for the 27-year-old. Sky 
                Sports News reported on Tuesday that Neymar had told PSG he wanted to leave, 
                while their manager Thomas Tuchel admitted on Wednesday that he knew the 
                Brazilian was keen on an exit before the Copa America. PSG sporting director 
                Leonardo said last week that Neymar could leave PSG "if there is an offer 
                that suits everyone", while also confirming "superficial contact" with Barcelona.
            </p>
                    
            <p> Sky sources understand PSG tried to convince Neymar to change his mind and 
                the Brazil international did not tell his club where he would like to move to.
                He was ruled out of the recent Copa America tournament - which Brazil won by 
                beating Peru 3-1 in the final - because of an ankle injury sustained in a 
                friendly against Qatar. PSG signed Neymar for a world-record fee of £200m 
                from Barcelona in August 2017.
